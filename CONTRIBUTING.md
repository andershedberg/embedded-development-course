The overall purpose is to make a fun and hands on course for someone that has basic programming knowledge but needs to self-study embedded development.

# Contributing

There are a couple of ways to get involved:

Report errors or make feature-requests by opening an issue at https://github.com/andershedberg/embedded-development-course/issues

If you want to add links, please write a short note about why that link is better than previous links and what it brings to the table. Include a short description as there are a number of resource pages on the web with very little information on what is actually covered on the linked resource and why you should watch that particular video/webpage.

Help fixing issues or improve documentation by creating pull-requests. When you would like to change or add new features, please discuss the feature first by creating an issue describing your feature, how you're planning to implement it, what the usecase is etc...
