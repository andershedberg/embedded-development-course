# embedded-development-course
An embedded development course from Arduino blinking to hard core optimizing of battery life on ARM cores.

Follow this flow - 
1. Basics. The Arduino is a well documented education platform that is used in many schools. Learn the basics of connecting hardware and doing software for IO with blinking lights, i2c libraries and simple timer interrupts. See [Arduino-excersises.md]

2. Wireless IoT communication. Learn how to send data with the most common protocols using wifi, lora and GSM networks to your computer with a dashboard.  https://docs.pycom.io/gettingstarted/ 

3. Real Time operating systems. Between the Arduino ( one-task endless loop programming ) and the Raspberry PiÂ´s full blown linux systems, there is a need for combining communication protocol stacks with high responsiveness to sensors and IO devices like accelerometers and motor-controllers and put the microcontroller to sleep. This is the domain of RTOS'es. One common one is FreeRTOS, now bought by Amazon for IoT usage.  https://aws.amazon.com/freertos/
