## Reverse engineering resources
Much of the debugging of embedded systems require a hands on approach, connecting probes to pins on chips and Ã¶istening to wireless radiotransmissions and decode what is actually sent there and on what frequencies. 
Some guides on hacking wireless home systems are a good introduction to the needed tools and practices.

Links to a lot of other resources like C-programming books and interesting tutorials on communication between wireless chips inside sensors.

Links to tools and documentaion about reverse engineering of bigger systems, but there are links to hex-editors that is often nice to have when you need to look at binary files which is often downloaded by programmers in the factory.
